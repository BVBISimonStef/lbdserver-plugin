React demo of the LBDserver Client API
This is a demo project for using the LBDserver (NodeJS) client API (npm i lbdserver-client-api) in a ReactJS environment.

How to install
git clone https://github.com/LBD-Hackers/lbdserver-api-demo-react
(node -v: 16 => tested with NodeJS 16)
npm install
npm run start

Pages:
There are two pages: one for demonstrating each function, and a very simple semantic enrichment page. You can find the former under /src/pages/Documentation/Dialogs (Page component in the /src/pages/DemoPages/index.js). The enrichment App can be found in as /src/pages/Enrichment/index.js.
